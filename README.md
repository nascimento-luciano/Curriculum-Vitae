I am a student of Control and Automation Engineering starting my professional career. I am currently looking for a position where I can make a difference by highlighting my skills while continuing to develop to become a better Engineer than I was yesterday.

## About

I am a simple person and at the same time a curious person and with an immense desire to make a difference. I am very fond of learning about new things and programming whenever I can. So I like to do my best in everything I do and when possible help others as well. My goal is to become better and better and not be inert. So, I intend to use my skills and grow while doing new things.
